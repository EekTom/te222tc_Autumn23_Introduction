I have always been interested in technology and the possibilities it entails. Yet, recent advancements in the capacity to store and analyze vast datasets have turned my interest into an almost all-consuming fascination. Data quantities that were once unmanageable can now be used to make informed decisions and train predictive algorithms, enabling us to see the forest for the trees.

This technology can greatly facilitate scientific research. In my own research field of neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience, brain-behavior relationships and patterns are still waiting to be discovered, hopefully 🙏🏼 leading to the alleviation of psychiatric and cognitive disorders. If you want to know more about my research please visit the following webpage:

You can also read open accesses scientific articles that are part of my research project:

Nevertheless, technology is no longer only a tool for understanding reality. It shapes our thoughts and opinions, and it's social and psychological effects should therefore continuously be subject for investigation. As one of my favorite authors **Yuval Noah Harari** formulated it: 

> *“If you don’t get to know yourself better, there is somebody out there who is, right now, trying to hack you."*
